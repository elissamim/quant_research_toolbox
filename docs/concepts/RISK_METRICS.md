### Skewness

Skewness measures the level of asymetry of a distribution of returns. A skew of 0 means that the distribution is perfectly symetrical, a positive skew corresponds to the situation of a distribution with long right tail (small losses and occasional large gains) and a negative skew corresponds to the situation of a distribution with long left tail (small gains and occasional large losses). The skewness is given by : $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(r_{i}-r)^{3}}{\sigma^{3}}$
