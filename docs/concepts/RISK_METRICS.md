### Skewness

Skewness measures the level of asymetry of a distribution of returns. A skew of 0 means that the distribution is perfectly symetrical, a positive skew corresponds to the situation of a distribution with long right tail (occasional large gains) and a negative skew corresponds to the situation of a distribution with long left tail (occasional large losses).
