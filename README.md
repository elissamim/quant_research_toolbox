Python toolbox for Quantitative Research:
- modules for alpha research and signal generation (momentum, mean-reversion)
- modules for strategy evaluation (risk, adjusted risk, performance metrics)
- AI agents for strategy evaluation

To use the LLM you need to provide a HuggingFace token for the model used after doing:
```bash
